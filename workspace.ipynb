Root nodes will have a  attribute and server generated markup will still contain . ( in ) ReactDOM will now render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation.

If you find any attributes that we have missed, please . ( in ) We fixed a bug in  that some components may rely on. If some of the  received by  are , it used to return an element with  values for those props. We’re changing it to be consistent with . Now any  props passed to  are resolved to the corresponding component’s . ( in ) This change won’t affect applications but may break some third-party tools. We are  and plan to release it during the 15.x cycle. The internal performance measurement format is subject to change so, for the time being, we consider the return value of  an opaque data structure that should not be relied upon.

      "release_features_and_fixes =   Previously we would generate a large string of HTML and then set . At the time, this was decided to be faster than using  for the majority of cases and browsers that we supported. Browsers have continued to improve and so overwhelmingly this is no longer true. By using  we can make other parts of React faster. ( in ) As a result of using , we can prime the node cache as we create DOM nodes, allowing us to skip a potential lookup (which used the  attribute). Root nodes will have a  attribute and server generated markup will still contain . ( in ) ReactDOM will now render plain text nodes interspersed with comment nodes that are used for demarcation. This gives us the same ability to update individual pieces of text, without creating extra nested nodes. If you were targeting these s in your CSS, you will need to adjust accordingly. You can always render them explicitly in your components. ( in ) Previously  would render to  elements. We now use comment nodes. This may cause issues if making use of  CSS selectors. While we consider this rendering behavior an implementation detail of React, it's worth noting the potential problem. () in ) We added support for  in React 0.14. However, React 0.14 still allowed you to define a class component without extending  or using , so , and did not allow returning  from it. This issue is solved in React 15, and you can now return  from any component, whether it is a class or a function. ( in ) All SVG tags are now fully supported. (Uncommon SVG tags are not present on the  element helper, but JSX and  work on all tag names.) All SVG attributes that are implemented by the browsers should be supported too. If you find any attributes that we have missed, please . ( in ) We fixed a bug in  that some components may rely on. If some of the  received by  are , it used to return an element with  values for those props. We’re changing it to be consistent with . Now any  props passed to  are resolved to the corresponding component’s . ( in ) This change won’t affect applications but may break some third-party tools. We are  and plan to release it during the 15.x cycle. The internal performance measurement format is subject to change so, for the time being, we consider the return value of  an opaque data structure that should not be relied upon. ( in )Deprecated APIs are removed from the  top-level export: , , , , and . As a reminder, they are now available on  and . ( in )Deprecated addons are removed:  and . ( in ,  in )Deprecated component instance methods are removed: , , and . ( in )Deprecated CommonJS  entry point is removed. As a reminder, you should use separate  packages instead. This only applies if you use the CommonJS builds. ( in )Passing  to void elements like  was deprecated, and now throws an error. ( in )React-specific properties on DOM  (e.g. ) were deprecated, and are removed now. ( in ) and  are now deprecated due to very low popularity. If you need this, you can use a wrapper component that implements the same behavior: . ( in )Future versions of React will treat  as a request to clear the input. However, React 0.14 has been ignoring . React 15 warns you on a  input value and offers you to clarify your intention. To fix the warning, you may explicitly pass an empty string to clear a controlled input, or pass  to make the input uncontrolled. ( in ) was renamed to , and  was renamed to . ( in )If you use a minified copy of the  build, React DOM kindly encourages you to use the faster production build instead. ( in )React DOM: When specifying a unit-less CSS value as a string, a future version will not add  automatically. This version now warns in this case (ex: writing . Unitless  values like  are unchanged. ( in )Synthetic Events will now warn when setting and accessing properties (which will not get cleared appropriately), as well as warn on access after an event has been returned to the pool. ( in  and  in )Elements will now warn when attempting to read  and  from the props. ( in )React will now warn if you pass a different  object to  in the constructor. ( in )React will now warn if you call  inside . ( in )React DOM now attempts to warn for mistyped event handlers on DOM elements, such as  which should be .
